**Youth Smoking and Drug Analysis**

**Overview:**

This project features a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that examines smoking and drug experimentation trends among youth. By analyzing factors such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, peer influence, and family background, this dashboard provides actionable insights into behaviors and trends in youth smoking and drug use.
**
Key Analysis and Visualizations**

Smoking Prevalence by Gender:

Visualizes the percentage breakdown of smoking prevalence across different genders, showing nearly equal rates among males, females, and combined groups.

Smoking Prevalence by Age Group:

Pie charts and line graphs highlight age groups with higher smoking rates, particularly focusing on ages 20-24 and 30-39, where smoking prevalence is notably higher.

Socioeconomic Impact on Smoking and Drug Experimentation:

Analyzes the prevalence of smoking and drug experimentation across socioeconomic levels (Middle, High, Low), revealing similar rates across all groups.

Drug Experimentation and Smoking Prevalence by Year:

Displays year-over-year trends in smoking and drug experimentation from 2020 to 2024, providing insights into shifts in behavior over time.

Peer Influence and Mental Health:

Represents the impact of peer influence and mental health factors on smoking, showing the effect of social and psychological factors on smoking habits.

School Programs' Influence:

Analyzes the influence of school programs on smoking prevalence, showing a balanced distribution between youth exposed and not exposed to such programs.

Family Background and Smoking Prevalence:

Breaks down smoking prevalence across various family backgrounds, providing insights into how family influences may shape smoking behavior.

**Tools & Techniques Used**

Power BI: Used for data visualization, interactive charts, and slicers to enable dynamic data exploration.
DAX and Power Query: Employed for data cleaning, transformation, and in-depth analysis.
Data Modeling: Created a structured data model to enhance visualization and manage relationships between data points.

**Project Insights**

The dashboard delivers clear insights into various factors impacting youth smoking and drug experimentation, making it a valuable tool for stakeholders in health trends, policy-making, and youth-focused awareness programs. Key metrics within the analysis identify potential intervention areas, particularly age groups and socioeconomic backgrounds where prevalence is higher.
